# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Added the ten-scientist consensus decision record in `grandplan.md` §A.8: canonical run log as source of truth, Rerun as Phases 1–3 diagnostic/time-machine viewer, Agent Bridge as the only control plane, and Tauri/SparkJS as the deferred Phase 4 control/editor/custom-rendering shell.
- Aligned first-party Markdown docs to the same Rerun/Tauri/SparkJS/licensing decision and clarified that optional live transport, external world models, GauSS-MI, and generated assets must emit canonical run-log artifacts.
- Updated the simulation spec license table for the checked Rerun/Tauri/SparkJS/Rerun WebViewer/Three.js package metadata and added release-governance reminders for local crate licenses, third-party notices, and model/data/asset audits.
- Added `crates/pid-runlog` as the first M1 implementation slice: versioned JSONL event schema, reader/writer, SHA-256 helpers, deterministic replay summary, and `pid-runlog-replay` CLI.
- Added bounded follow-up slices for the 10-step plan: embedding/sim/bridge run-log events, replay hash comparison, `crates/pid-bridge`, `crates/pid-sim`, a run-log-to-Rerun adapter/CLI, `just` smoke recipes, and `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` release-governance groundwork.
- Added the next validation/dispatch slice: run-log structural validation, payload-hash/monotonicity checks, CLI `--validate`, bridge dispatcher abstraction, sim bridge handler/session, `pid-sim-bridge-demo`, `Flow_gt` verification helpers, and CI run-log smoke commands.
- Added the next provenance/API slice: compact run-log summaries, manifest JSON generation, JSON-RPC-shaped bridge request conversion, `pid-sim-verify`, stricter run-log validation before Rerun conversion, and CI smoke coverage for summary/manifest/flow verification.
- Added canonical `evaluation_metric`, `label_observed`, and `embedding_contract` run-log events plus a deterministic toy VLA/task harness with success labels, a replay-linked toy `(V,L,D,A)` contract, PID/CI features, non-PID baseline metrics, summary JSON, canonical run-log export, `just toy-harness`, and CI validation smoke.
- Added Agent Bridge read-only safe-mode metadata/enforcement plus a stdio `--safe-mode` smoke path that logs blocked mutating requests as bridge error responses.
- Added deterministic sim backend/solver provenance config logging for sim demo, bridge demo, and stdio bridge run logs, with validation that logged `config_hash` values match canonical config JSON.
- Tightened replay/provenance gates: run-log validation now checks `run_started`/`config_logged` hash consistency, summaries/manifests expose `config_hash`, replay compare exits nonzero on mismatches, and the sim bridge implements safe-mode `log.replay`.
- Added a loopback TCP JSON-RPC Agent Bridge transport (`pid-sim-bridge-tcp`) for the deterministic sim, with canonical run-log emission and CI validation/replay smoke coverage.
- Added first-class `flow_pred` run-log events plus deterministic constant-velocity baseline predictions for sim run logs, replay summaries, Rerun conversion, and CI smoke assertions.

## 10.1 (2026-01-08)

- Clarified the v10.1 “Rerun-First” sequencing vs the Phase 4+ target UI stack (scope notes + reading guide) and tightened “spec-only vs implemented” labeling in `grandplan.md`.
- Fixed minor doc drift and numbering in the system-architecture blueprint portion of `grandplan.md` (e.g., §C.1/§C.2 ordering; asset→collision-proxy wording; pseudocode semantics for splat edits).
- Tightened verification language to be offline-friendly: referenced the local `outputs/arxiv_ref_cache.json` cache instead of “arXiv API”, scrubbed unverified latency placeholders in historical notes, and removed unverifiable license specifics (e.g., InternVLA‑A1).
- Added `scripts/audit_grandplan.py`, `scripts/audit_grandplan_claims.py`, and `scripts/update_arxiv_ref_cache.py` to audit arXiv coverage/title drift, scan for high-risk doc drift, and (optionally) refresh the local arXiv metadata cache used for offline verification.
- Updated `.gitignore` so `outputs/arxiv_ref_cache.json` can be tracked while keeping other `outputs/` artifacts ignored.
- Updated docset alignment markers across the documentation set to v10.1 where applicable (`README.md`, `DIAGRAMS.md`, `EXPERIMENTS.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `uidesigner/UI.md`, and optional module specs).

## 10.0 (2026-01-05)

- Integrated the optional GauSS‑MI spec across the docset: reconstruction uncertainty maps, uncertainty‑aware diagnostics/weighting (optional), and active view selection as confound controls (`grandplan.md` §C.2, `GAUSS_MI_INTEGRATION.md`, `DIAGRAMS.md`).
- Slimmed `README.md` to a brief entrypoint that links to the canonical spec/protocol docs and the engineering plan.
- Bumped docset alignment references from v9.0 → v10.0 across the documentation set.
- Added `uidesigner/UI.md` and `uidesigner/prompt_loop.py` to iteratively design the viewer-first UI (M1→M2→M4→M8) using gpt‑image (via FAL) + Gemini critique loops (Vertex AI), with artifacts saved per UI part.
- Fixed Mermaid syntax robustness in `DIAGRAMS.md` (sequence diagram note formatting; expanded multi-input edges) to improve rendering in common Mermaid toolchains.
- Added LuckyRobots/Lucky World as an emerging simulator comparator and distilled ML-first simulator lessons (RL-style `reset/step`, WebSocket control planes, external-backend adapters that still emit canonical run logs) across `grandplan.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `EXPERIMENTS.md`, and `DIAGRAMS.md`.
- Added Physical Intelligence PI “π” series (`π0`, `π0.5`, `π0.6*`) as a vendor/black-box VLA comparator with explicit “verify access + embeddings” caveats (`grandplan.md`, `EXPERIMENTS.md`).

## 9.0 (2026-01-05)

- Promoted an explicit v9.0 execution sequence (M0–M7) with acceptance criteria in `grandplan.md` (§A.7) so engineering can begin without re-interpreting the spec.
- Restructured `README.md` to lead with hypotheses + experiments, then map directly to the engineering build order (gate-driven, contract-first).
- Bumped docset alignment to v9.0 across `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `DIAGRAMS.md`, `EXPERIMENTS.md`, and `pidsplatspecs.md`, and clarified offline-first run logs + replay vs optional live transports (Zenoh).
- Added a multi-engine physics reality check: per-object mixed backends are a co-simulation problem; prefer one backend per run plus optional cross-backend replay as a robustness/confound control (`grandplan.md` §E.1).

## 8.0 (2026-01-05)

- Corrected SparkJS assumptions: documented SparkJS “Spark” as a Three.js-integrated WebGL2 3DGS renderer (with links), and made renderer requirements backend-agnostic (WebGL2/WebGPU) where appropriate.
- Clarified contacts/collisions in 3DGS-based simulators: updated SplatSim (PyBullet physics backbone) and DISCOVERSE (MuJoCo physics backbone) notes, and made PID‑Splat’s default collision path explicitly mesh/URDF/MJCF-driven (with splat-field collision heuristics treated as optional research).
- Updated hypothesis set: added **H8** (geometry gate → estimator regime choice), narrowed **H2/H3** into falsifiable ablation/intervention claims, and softened optional world-model extension hypotheses (H_WM1–H_WM5) to avoid pre-committed outcomes.
- Expanded model/flow survey: added SmolVLA to the VLA reference list and added RAFT (arXiv:2003.12039) as a non-generative flow baseline for `Flow_obs`.

## 7.0 (2026-01-05)

- Scientific audit pass across the docset: removed or downgraded unsourced performance/hardware/roadmap claims; switched to measurement-first language.
- Reworked `grandplan.md` VLA integration into a contract-first framing (`V/L/D/A` must be defined and logged per checkpoint; no assumed layer names/shapes).
- Added a risk-reducing execution sequence: Exp0 → harness bring-up with simulator-derived `Flow_gt` → small baseline (e.g., SmolVLA) → primary VLA (e.g., OpenVLA) → optional diffusion/predictor-driven Flow.
- Clarified H1 as “PID features ↔ failure labels” (synergy sign is a candidate feature, not a definition of hallucination).
- Added/updated Agent Bridge requirements (GUI and automation share one control plane; JSON-RPC/MCP; all interventions logged and replayable).
- Added OpenUSD/USDZ interop notes (LeIsaac Marble tutorial; `.ply → .usdz` via NVIDIA 3DGrut) as an optional workflow.
- Added InternVLA‑A1 as an optional diffusion/flow-matching VLA candidate for stage-wise ablations (with explicit license/verification caveats).
